    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>For this project, I want to elaborate on my previous jquery project, which featured a mirror with a moving image which changed when it was clicked on. I simultaneously wanted to
        develop my introduction "choose your own adventure" page.
    The goal of the new website is to create a choice based “web browser game” where clicking on different images or links will lead players through various paths, which ultimately tell a story. 
    The mirrors could be thought of as “portals”. Since there are various paths, the player can have a different experience each time. 
    I also am considering embedding music or audio files to create a more immersive experience. 
    I was simultaneously influenced by online args (alternate reality games), specifically due to the mysteries which typically lie within them.

    <p>My original website looked like this:</p>
    <img src="about.png" height="300">
    <br>
    <img src="initial_site.png" height="300">
    <br>
    <h2>Examples/References</h2>
    <a href="https://penrose.doublespeakgames.com/">Penrose, a nonlinear narrative game</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room, an idle game</a>

    <br>
    <p>Another example (or what could be traced as my initial inspiration) is this
        odd ARG tied to a short film on Adult Swim. By interacting with the site, the user is able to learn the
        username and password, and eventually sign in and find hidden videos/secrets. While I do not plan to bring my project in this specific 
        direction, it provided the idea of having a user input responses to move on to different pages.
